subtitle: and what you can do about it

Whilst mentoring developers inside and out of my immediate teams, I've noticed trends in frustration were some fixate on becoming a Technical Lead before they have developed the skills to fill the role adequately. I've not only see this with senior developers but also much more junior developers where they clearly do not have the skill or experience to be a technical lead a development team. Whilst it's great to have drive and ambition, it's dangerous to fall into this trap as it may lead to rejection, unnecessary stress and feeling that you're not doing a good job in your current role when the truth may be to the contrary.

Here are some of the reasons I've personally experienced and a few tips to make progress. This won't be exhaustive so I'd love to hear your thoughts over in the comments or on social media.

### 1. Good technical ability, not enough business experience
Symptom: A developer has a sound grounding in programming, putting hours in on side projects and experiments.

Cure: 
### Spending more time learning new technologies than actually producing with well established ones
Symptom: It's a great feeling to be working on new technologies and pushing yourself and it to the limit. New technologies can absolutely become the next big thing so it a good idea to continue experimenting with them and getting an understanding of how they will fit in to your systems.

Cure: These experimentations should initially be confined to investigative spikes if the technologies seem immediately relevant to an existing problem or to innovation/pet projects if there's no current need for such a tool.

### 2. You keep knowledge to yourself

### 3. You focus too much on tech not the business

### 4. You don't work with other teams

### 5. You don't develop others

### 6. You over engineer

### 7. You make simple things complex
