	  <p>During my time as a developer I’ve noticed some really good devs become frustrated that their goal of becoming a Technical Lead has not been realised. In some cases developers can fixate on the tech lead role before they have developed the skills to fill the role adequately. I’ve not only seen this with senior developers but also much more junior developers where they clearly do not have the skill or experience to be a technical lead in a development team. Whilst it’s great to have drive and ambition, it’s dangerous to fall into this trap as it may lead to rejection, unnecessary stress and feeling that you’re not doing a good job in your current role when the truth may be to the contrary.</p>

<p>Here are some of the reasons that a good developer may not be ready to become a technical lead and a few tips on how to progress. This won’t be exhaustive so I’d love to hear your thoughts over in the comments or on social media.</p>

<h3 id="good-technical-ability-not-enough-business-experience">1. Good technical ability, not enough business experience</h3>
<p>Some developers build a sound grounding in programming through study, side projects and experimentation but lack experience working with a client or within an enterprise environment. These developers can suffer through a variety of ways. Some may over promise to please stakeholders and work long unsociable hours or compromise heavily on quality to compensate. Whereas others may neglect their stakeholders and lean far too much on the technical aspect of a project, ending up late and over engineered.</p>

<p>A good tech lead can balance the team producing value to their client in a timely timely fashion whilst keeping a sustainable pace and high quality. A good tech lead also ensures technical debt is kept in check and paid off regularly.
See: KISS, YANGNI, Extreme programming</p>

<h3 id="too-much-development-time-investigating-and-learning-new-technologies-than-producing">2. Too much development time investigating and learning new technologies than producing</h3>
<p>It’s a great feeling to be working on new technologies and pushing yourself and the tech to the limit. New technologies can absolutely become the next big thing so it a good idea to continue experimenting with them and getting an understanding of how they will fit in to your systems. Sometimes developers become too concerned with picking the perfect tool to avoid reworking or the shame of picking the wrong technology, this may result in major delays for greenfield projects or rewrites. There may also be risk in picking a product that is not production ready.</p>

<p>Experimentations should initially be confined to time boxed investigative spikes if the technologies seem immediately relevant to an existing problem. Picking a tool that is good enough for the current and near future problems should not be met with blame if the technology cannot handle future requirements. If there is a blame culture in the organisation this needs to be stamped out.
If there is no current need for a new technology, Hackdays, innovation time and pet projects should be used to investigate and ultimately have fun.
See: google 20% time, hackdays, Analysis paralysis, organisational change, fear of failure</p>

<h3 id="hoarding-knowledge">3. Hoarding knowledge</h3>
<p>Good developers understand that the role requires continuous learning. Unfortunately some developers are protective of their knowledge or findings and do not share this with others. This manifests itself in many ways: silos of code experts, poor documentation, separate solutions to debugging and working practices,</p>

<h3 id="you-dont-work-with-other-teams">4. You don’t work with other teams</h3>

<h3 id="you-dont-develop-others">5. You don’t develop others</h3>

<h3 id="youre-the-hero">6. You’re the hero</h3>
<p>You make simple things complex
Over engineer</p>

<h3 id="you-just-want-to-code">7. You just want to code</h3>
<p>Being a Tech lead is not actually for everyone.</p>
